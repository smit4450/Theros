## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [[panther-xmm|Panther]] stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [[giant-goat-xmm|Giant Goat]] stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.
