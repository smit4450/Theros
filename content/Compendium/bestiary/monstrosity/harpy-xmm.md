## Harpy

*Winged Voice of Doom*

- **Habitat.** Coastal, Forest, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Hate-filled creatures, harpies strive to cause pain and bring an end to love and life. These monsters combine humanlike features with the talons and wings of avian scavengers. Their notorious songs compel listeners to follow them, heedless of danger. Creatures captivated by a harpy's song frequently meet their deaths on harpies' vicious claws or amid natural perils.

Harpies dwell in remote, dismal places tainted by tragedy and despair. Some tales claim harpies offended the gods and were transformed as a punishment; harpies might also be the descendants of such cursed souls.

Every harpy sings a distinct song. While some songs are said to be heartbreaking in their beauty, others are wretched squawking and compel only the magically enthralled.
