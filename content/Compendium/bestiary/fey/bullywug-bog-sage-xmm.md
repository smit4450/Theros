![](Compendium/bestiary/fey/img/bullywugs.webp#right|850)  
Bullywug bog sages channel the magic of the swamp to sicken foes and speak with plants.

## Bullywugs

*Amphibious Appreciators of Marsh and Muck*

- **Habitat.** Swamp  
- **Treasure.** [[random-magic-items-implements|Implements]], Individual  

Fey embodiments of swamplands, bullywugs protect the murky wilds and consider themselves cosmically favored for that role. These human-size, toad- or frog-like creatures have close relationships with the creatures of the swamp.
